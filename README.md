Welcome to my personal repository of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Python. This collection is thoughtfully organized, cleanly coded, and structured for clarity, performance, and precision.

üìò Python DSA Collection

This repository is a structured collection of core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented using Python.
Each folder represents a specific topic and contains one or more code examples demonstrating its use.

üìÇ Repository Structure

üîπ Data Structures

Array-Datastructure
Basic operations on arrays such as traversal, insertion, deletion, and searching.

Linked List
Examples of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.

Stack
Stack implementation using lists and custom classes with push/pop operations.

Queue
Queue examples including linear and circular queues.

Hash Table
Simple hashing and collision resolution methods.

Tree
Generic tree structure, traversal methods, and node operations.

Binary Search Tree Part1 & Part2
In-depth examples of BST creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal.

üîπ Algorithms

Binary Search
Efficient search using divide and conquer.

Bubble Sort
Basic comparison-based sorting algorithm.

Insertion Sort
